            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chicken adobo is considered the national dish of the Philippines. The combination of soy sauce, vinegar, <br>
                garlic, ginger, and peppercorns is delicious and actually preserves the chicken! My mother taught me <br>
                how to cook this using her variation on the original recipe. It's a delicious, cheap, and easy dish. <br>
                Serve with hot, steamed Jasmine rice.</p>
